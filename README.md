The tasks I have completed during the course of Internet of Things
We were working with Raspberry Pi Pico W.
Used CircuitPython.

1. Making the LED light pulse, using PWM.
2. Measuring temperature with NTC thermistor.
3. Creating a simple webpage, which outputs temperature and processor's parameters.
